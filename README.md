**##TASK FIVE : ARRAYS AND STRING:**    
•	Write a JAVA program that takes given String of words and return the length of the shortest word.  
•	Write a JAVA program that gives sum of all the values of array except the highest and lowest values.  
•	Write a JAVA method to remove all the spaces from the String and return the resultant.  
•	Write a JAVA method to return a boolean true if the string doesn’t have repeating letters and consecutive or nonconsecutive i.e. all the letters of the string be unique (isogram) else false.  
o	Write a JAVA program that reverse the words of a sentence.  
	For eg, => “Be Happy and Stay Motivated” => “eB yppah dna yatS detavitoM”.  
•	Write a JAVA program that takes out the even from the odds and odd from the list of even numbers,  
For eg, => {23,25,75,87,47,1,91,51,2} //Output for this case =>2  
•	=> {22,44,64,76,98,12,43,54,90} // Output for this case =>43.  
•	Write a JAVA program that swaps the case of the alphabets of the string,  
o	For eg, => “heLLo WOrLd” => “HEllO woRlD”.  
•	Write a JAVA program that gives boolean values; true, if the string has balanced braces and false, if the string has unbalanced braces:  
•	For eg, => “({{)}[}]()” //output => true  
•	//valid parenthesis  
•	{{( [ ) ] }} => “[})(” //output => false.

   
**##TASK SIX: CLASSES AND OBJECTS**  
1.	Print the sum, difference and product of two complex numbers by creating a class named 'Complex' with separate methods for each operation whose real and imaginary parts are entered by user.  

2.	Write a program that would print the information (name, year of joining, salary, address) of three employees by creating a class named 'Employee'. The output should be as follows:  
Name     Year of joining      Address  
Robert    1994                64C- Walls Street  
Sam        2000               68D- Walls Street  
John       1999               26B- Walls Street  


3.	Write a program to print the names of students by creating a Student class. If no name is passed while creating an object of Student class, then the name should be "Unknown", otherwise the name should be equal to the String value passed while creating object of Student class. (Hint: Overloading concept)  

4.	Create a class named 'Rectangle' with two data members- length and breadth and a method to calculate the area which is 'length*breadth'. The class has three constructors which are :  
4.1.	 having no parameter - values of both length and breadth are assigned zero.  
4.2.	 having two numbers as parameters - the two numbers are assigned as length and breadth respectively.  
4.3.	 having one number as parameter - both length and breadth are assigned that number.  
4.4.	 Now, create objects of the 'Rectangle' class having none, one and two parameters and print their areas.   

5.	Suppose you have a Saving Box with an initial amount of $50 and you have to add some more to it. Create a class 'AddAmount' with a data member named 'amount' with an initial value of $50. Now make two constructors of this class as follows:  
5.1.	without any parameter - no amount will be added to the Saving Box  
5.2.	having a parameter which is the amount that will be added to Saving Box  
5.3.	 Create object of the 'AddAmount' class and display the final amount in Saving Box. Also, create a method that can display how many transactions are done on the Saving Box.  
6.	Create a class named 'Programming'. While creating an object of the class, if nothing is passed to it, then the message "I love programming languages" should be printed. If some String is passed to it, then in place of "programming languages" the name of that String variable should be printed.  
For example, while creating object if we pass "Java", then "I love Java" should be printed. There can be more than one programming languages.  


**##TASK SEVEN: PROGRAMMING QUESTIONS**  
1.	Program to reverse a string in java  
2.	Program to find the first non-repeated character in the String  
3.	Program to find the intersection of two arrays in java?    
4.	Program to find if String has all Unique Characters?  
5.	Program to Count the number of words in the String?  
6.	Program to check the number is Armstrong number?  
7.	Program to Count occurrences of each character in a string in java?  
8.	Print all permutations of the String  
9.	Find the maximum value in Array without using Collection?  
10.	Find all possible combinations of String? (using recursion)  
11.	Find to sort HashMap in java by keys and values?  
12.	Program to find all the sub-array whose sum is equal to the given number?
